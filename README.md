# Supermarket

## Description
This project is a coding challenge set by MoJ D&T in November 2022 for a practical assessment component of the Senior Developer interview.

## Task
```
In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial world we've
decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three products:


| Product code |     Name     |  Price  |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
|      FR1     |   Fruit tea  |    £3.11|
|      SR1     | Strawberries |    £5.00|
|      CF1     |    Coffee    |   £11.23|


Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers. She wants us to add a rule to
apply this rule to fruit tea.
The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a
price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should
drop to £4.50 each.
Our checkout can scan items in any order.
The CEO and COO change their minds often, so ideally this should be a flexible
solution (if you have time). For example, we might want to apply the offers to
different products, or add products to our range, as the supermarket grows.
Task
Your goal is to implement a checkout that scans items in and calculates total prices
correctly for any combination of the products and offers above.
